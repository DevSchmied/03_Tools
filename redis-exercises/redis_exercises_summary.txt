Create a list named `tasks` and add elements `task1`, `task2`, `task3`

LPUSH tasks task1
LPUSH tasks task2
LPUSH tasks task3


Get and display the first element of the list `tasks`

LPOP tasks


Delete the first element of the list `tasks`

LPOP tasks


Add the element `task4` to the end of the list `tasks`

RPUSH tasks task4


Get and display all elements of the list `tasks`

LRANGE tasks 0 -1

Exercise #3: Working with Sets
Description: In this exercise, you will learn how to work with Redis sets, adding and removing elements, and checking for element existence.
Tasks:

Create a set named `fruits` and add elements `apple`, `banana`, `cherry`

SADD fruits apple
SADD fruits banana
SADD fruits cherry


Check if the element `apple` exists in the set `fruits`

SISMEMBER fruits apple


Add the element `orange` to the set `fruits`

SADD fruits orange


Remove the element `banana` from the set `fruits`

Exercise #4: Working with Hashes
Description: In this exercise, you will learn how to work with Redis hashes, setting, getting, and updating hash fields.
Tasks:

Create a hash named `user` and set the fields `name` to `Alice`, `age` to `30`, and `email` to `alice@example.com`

HSET user name Alice
HSET user age 30
HSET user email alice@example.com


Get the value of the field `name` from the hash `user` and display it

HGET user name


Update the value of the field `age` in the hash `user` to `31`

HSET user age 31


Add a new field `phone` to the hash `user` with the value `1234567890`

HSET user phone 1234567890


Get and display all fields and values of the hash `user`

HGETALL user

Exercise #5: Working with Sorted Sets
Description: In this exercise, you will learn how to work with Redis sorted sets, adding and removing elements, and retrieving elements in ascending and descending order.
Tasks:

Create a sorted set named `scores` and add elements `player1` with score `100`, `player2` with score `200`, and `player3` with score `150`

ZADD scores 100 player1
ZADD scores 200 player2
ZADD scores 150 player3


Get and display all elements of the sorted set `scores` in ascending order

ZRANGE scores 0 -1 WITHSCORES


Increment the score of `player1` by 50

ZINCRBY scores 50 player1


Remove the element `player2` from the sorted set `scores`

ZREM scores player2


Get and display all elements of the sorted set `scores` in descending order

ZREVRANGE scores 0 -1 WITHSCORES
